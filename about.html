            <h2>The Story Behind Zongzi</h2>
            <p class="section1">Qu Yuan was a loyal poet and minister in ancient China. When he saw his country fall into danger, he was very sad and jumped into the river on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month.

                To honor him, people threw rice dumplings (zongzi) into the river to feed the fish and paddled dragon boats to search for his body. These acts became the Dragon Boat Festival traditions.</p>
